# Topdanmark microfrontend project

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Microfrontend aka HybridApp is a react application created with the create-react-app cli but with
Topdanmark specific configuration scripts. The react-script project have been modified to suit the
requirements for creating a production build of a microfrontend that can be deployed in a base app.

It is still possible to eject the configuration by running `yarn eject`. You can then modify
the configuration to your specific needs, you will not receive updates just by incrementing
the version for `c9-react-scripts` inside your `package.json` file.
